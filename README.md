# ACE Planner
ACE Planner is a dissertation project that uses Protégé  5.x semantic web ontology interface and ACE View, an ontology editor for Protégé  that uses ACE (Attempto Controlled English). The dissertation explored the possibility of having a language driven planning methodology, where users can configure a planner similar to a PDDL to write in English the actions, preconditions, results, goals and domains.

## About ACE View

ACE View is project created by Kaarel Kaljurand (https://github.com/Kaljurand) which has the original source code at https://github.com/Kaljurand/aceview . The version worked with earlier versions of Protégé (only personally tested with Protégé 4 versions) , and the code was updated to use the new Protégé 5.x versions. The installation for this new ACE View includes the ACE Planner, and can be built using local maven configurations and setting up Eclipse to run the Ant build.
