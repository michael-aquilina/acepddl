/**
 * This class implements the MAX heuristic. (for more details on this heuristic
 * see Blai Bonet and Hector Geffner, Planning as Heuristic Search, Artificial
 * Intelligence 129, 2001, Elsevier)
 * <p>
 * The principle of this heuristics function <i>h</i> is to resolved a relaxed
 * the planning problem <i>P'</i> in which all delete list are ignored. The cost
 * of achieving an atom <i>p</i> form the state <i>s</i> is noted <i>gs(p)</i>.
 * These estimates can be defined recursively as:
 * <ul>
 * <li><i>gs(p)</i> = 0, if <i>p</i> is in <i>s</i>,
 * <li><i>gs(p)</i> = min[1 + <i>gs(Prec(op))]</i> for each <i>op</i> in
 * <i>O(p)</i>, otherwise
 * </ul>
 * where <i>O(p)</i> stands for the actions <i>op</i> that add <i>p</i>, i.e.,
 * with <i>p</i> in <i>Add(op)</i>, and <i>gs(Prec(op))</i>, to be defined
 * below, stands for the estimated cost of achieving the preconditions of action
 * <i>op</i> from <i>s</i>. The cost <i>gs(C)</i> of a sets of atoms is defined
 * as the max costs of individual atoms:
 * <ul>
 * <li><i>hmax(C)</i> = max <i>gs(r)</i> for all <i>r</i> in <i>C</i> (max
 * costs)
 * </ul>
 * The max heuristic unlike the additive heuristic SUM_ID is admissible as the
 * cost of achieving a set of atoms cannot be lower than the cost of achieving
 * each of the atoms in the set. On the other hand, the max heuristic is often
 * less informative. In fact, while the additive heuristic combines the costs of
 * all subgoals, the max heuristic focuses only on the most difficult subgoals
 * ignoring all others.
 * </p>
 * <b>Warning:</b> The max heuristic is admissible.
