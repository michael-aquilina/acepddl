/**
 * This class implements the heuristics of the fast forward planner. For more
 * about this heuristic see J. Hoffmann, A Heuristic for DOMAIN Independent
 * Planning and its Use in an Enforced Hill-climbing Algorithm, in: Proceedings
 * of the 12th International Symposium on Methodologies for Intelligent Systems,
 * Charlotte, North Carolina, USA, October 2000.
 * <p>
 * The computation of the value returned by the heuristics is based on the
 * extraction of a relaxed plan to the planning graph ignoring negative effects
 * according to the difficulty heuristic. The heuristic value is the number of
 * actions of the relaxed plan extracted. To select an effect according to the
 * unconditional operators difficulty heuristic, the question is, which achiever
 * should be choose when no NOOP is available ? It is certainly a good idea to
 * select an achiever whose preconditions seems to be "easy". From the graph
 * building phase, we can obtain a simple measure for the operators_difficulty
 * of an action's preconditions as follows:
 * </p>
 * 
 * <pre>
 * difficulty(o) := SUM_ID(min { i | p is member of the fact layer at time i }) with p in pre(o)
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * The operators_difficulty of each action can be set when it is first inserted
 * into the graph. During plan extraction, facing a fact for which no NOOP is
 * available, we then simply selected an achieving action with minimal
 * operators_difficulty. This heuristic works well in situation where there are
 * severals ways to achieve one fact. but some ways need less effort than
 * others.
 * </p>
 * <b>Warning:</b> The relaxed plan heuristic is not admissible.
