/**
 * This class implement the concept of inertia. An inertia can be POSTIVE,
 * NEGATIVE, FLUENT or only INERTIA according to the following definitions:
 * <p>
 * Definition 1. A relation is a positive inertia if and only if it does not
 * occur positively in an unconditional effect or the consequent of a
 * conditional effect of an operator.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Definition 2. A relation is a negative inertia if and only if it does not
 * occur negatively in an unconditional effect or the consequent of a
 * conditional effect of an operator.
 * </p>
 * The pre-processing proceeds over the domain and problem description and
 * collects all used relation names. For each relation it checks if it satisfies
 * one of the following definitions: Relations, which are positive as well as
 * negative inertia, are simply called inertia. Relations, which are neither
 * positive nor negative inertia, are called fluents. The detection of inertia
 * and fluents is easy because in ADL, effects are restricted to conjunctions of
 * literals. Furthermore, this information can be obtained with a single pass
 * over the domain description, which takes almost no time at all.
