/**
 * This class implements the SUM_ID heuristic. (for more details on this
 * heuristic see Blai Bonet and Hector Geffner, Planning as Heuristic Search,
 * Artificial Intelligence 129, 2001, Elsevier)
 * <p>
 * The principle of this heuristics function <i>h</i> is to resolved a relaxed
 * the planning problem <i>P'</i> in which all delete list are ignored. The cost
 * of achieving an atom <i>p</i> form the state <i>s</i> is noted <i>gs(p)</i>.
 * These estimates can be defined recursively as:
 * <ul>
 * <li><i>gs(p)</i> = 0, if <i>p</i> is in <i>s</i>,
 * <li><i>gs(p)</i> = min[1 + <i>gs(Prec(op))]</i> for each <i>op</i> in
 * <i>O(p)</i>, otherwise
 * </ul>
 * where <i>O(p)</i> stands for the actions <i>op</i> that add <i>p</i>, i.e.,
 * with <i>p</i> in <i>Add(op)</i>, and <i>gs(Prec(op))</i>, to be defined
 * below, stands for the estimated cost of achieving the preconditions of action
 * <i>op</i> from <i>s</i>. The cost <i>gs(C)</i> of a sets of atoms is defined
 * as the weighted sum of the costs of individual atoms:
 * <ul>
 * <li><i>hsum(C)</i> = sum <i>gs(r)</i> for all <i>r</i> in <i>C</i> (additive
 * costs)
 * </ul>
 * The heuristic assumes that subgoals are independent. This is not true in
 * general as the achievement of some subgoals can make the achievement of the
 * other subgoals more or less difficult. For this reason, the additive
 * heuristic is not admissible (i.e., it may overestimate the true costs).
 * </p>
 * <b>Warning:</b> The sum heuristic is admissible.
